# Rob's Emacs Configuration

This is the Emacs setup I use everywhere. The structure of the configuration is
heavily influened by [magnars](https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d). I highly
recommend checking out his configuration and the [Emacs
Rocks](http://emacsrocks.com) screencast if you are interested in learning more
about tailoring Emacs to your needs.

## Setup

If you want to use this configuration yourself, simply clone this repository
into your home directory.

```bash
cd ~
git clone git://github.com/rcdickerson/.emacs.d.git
```

The first time you open Emacs, some packages will be automatically installed
from MELPA to your ~/.emacs.d/elpa directory.
